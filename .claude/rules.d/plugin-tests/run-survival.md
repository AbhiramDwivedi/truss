## Factory module list

`factory-split-031.check.ts` pins the files in `bin/factory/` with `MODULES`: a `.ts` file it does not list fails the test. Put a new `cmd*` function into a module already listed, such as `runs.ts` (`cmdFindRun`), unless the tester adds the new module to `MODULES` and to architecture.md.
